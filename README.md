# Answer-The-Number
This is my first Python project.
This is a program that makes a random number from 1 to... which one you specify.
You need to set the right border first, and then guess the number that the program has guessed.
The program does not yet have English, it is only in Russian.
In the future, a language selection (English, Russian) will be added to it and all the bugs will be fixed.
